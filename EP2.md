- In the first phase of memory creation, JavaScript allocates memory to all the variables and functions in a program. The second phase is the code execution phase, in which the code is executed.

- In the first video, JavaScript code is displayed and explained. The "2" is placed inside the "n" placeholder and the value of n is undefined. In the second video, the "2" is allocated to n and the execution context is created. In the third video, the code execution phase is explained and the memory for n and ans is allocated. In the fourth video, the value of n is 2 is passed to num and num is passed to ans.

- The video explains how code is executed by showing how the value of num*num is stored in memory and replaced by undefined when the return statement is encountered.
- JavaScript executes code line by line, and each line executes a function. The call stack keeps track of where each function was called, and when the function is finished executing, the call stack is deleted.

- In this video, the author explains how JavaScript code is executed, and how the call stack is used to keep track of the order of execution of execution contexts.
